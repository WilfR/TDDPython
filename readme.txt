Use the TDDPython environment.
See https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html for info on environments.

Here is how I created the virtual environment :

conda create -n TDDPython
conda activate TDDPython
pip install "django<1.12" "selenium<4"
prompt (TDDPython) $p$g
